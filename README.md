# Decoding Sentiments: Machine Learning for Yelp Reviews 🌟

## Overview 🚀
**Decoding Sentiments** is a powerful sentiment analysis project designed to classify Yelp reviews into sentiment-based categories using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes Python and several advanced data processing and machine learning libraries to predict whether a review is positive or negative based on its content. By analyzing text data from Yelp, this system provides insights into customer sentiments, aiding businesses in understanding and improving customer satisfaction.

## Features 🛠
- **Text Processing**: Implement tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to prepare text data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use machine learning models to categorize reviews into positive or negative sentiments.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate insightful charts to display sentiment trends and patterns.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to filter reviews based on sentiment, date, and other criteria.

## Technologies Used 💻
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical data handling
- Scikit-learn for building sentiment classification models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing
